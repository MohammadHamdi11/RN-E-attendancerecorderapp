i get this error. the link to the file: https://github.com/MohammadHamdi11/RN-E-attendancerecorderapp/blob/main/assets/students_data.json

i am not familiar with coding in general so i will need you to guide me through the process; i am not a coder; i will have to edit this app in iterations, so make it that i can just copy and paste simple parts of it.
